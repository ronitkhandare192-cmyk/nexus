# Prompt 1: 

# I want you to create a website for the Vibe Coding Challenge according to the requirements below for my team's submission for the Alibaba JUMPSTARTER ZPIRE Program, an AI innovation challenge. We have been shortlisted, meaning our pitch deck was satisfactory. Importantly, there is a 15-page pitch deck called AI-Trainer attached for you. Below is a part of the email my team and I received after passing the selection round: Ideation Challenge (100% of Round 1 Score) This is the core of Round 1. You need to develop and submit a comprehensive pitch deck that brings your wellness solution to life. (This is the same as what is attached for you, GPT5). This is the part you need to focus on, GPT5. 2. Vibe Coding Challenge (Bonus 25% on Round 1 Score) This is your chance to showcase your creativity through a front-end landing page (web or app) that presents your idea. It should be: Relatively simple. Front end only (HTML CSS JS or any framework) No live functionality needed – Focus on design and presentation Bonus points if your landing page is mobile-friendly (maybe you can use @media queries?) Before you generate a landing page, please consider carefully what would be essential to have on such a landing page for judges who hold either considerable business or tech savvy according to the Pitch Deck attached, as well as the requirements and Criteria for judgment. Tell me those considerations, and then generate the page. Do not overflood the page by just putting all the info from the pdf in.

# Response:

# For this prompt, it was very specific and provided context and our PDF file for the overall contents of the site. GPT-5 was told to first think through the contents of the webpage according to the context window given as well as the PDF file attached, and then start coding, and responded by giving code for a one-pager website that was coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a good start in terms of the structure, but it had a dark theme and was rather poorly structured, so further prompting had to be done

# Prompt 2:

# Tell me if you are GPT5. Also, make the theme light mode-like. Remove the Open Pitch Deck button as well. And the footer. Also add some placeholder images and tell me the exact line in the code you added it in.

# Response:

# For this prompt, we first ensured the model was GPT-5 by asking, and it responded yes. Then, GPT-5 fixed the previous errors and made some design adjustments, including turning the page light themed without any blue accents and unfortunately, it didn't succeed in adding in images for the sections of the webpage, so another prompt was given.

# Prompt 3:

# Could you make the Simulation buttons centred? Also make the website better-spaced, maybe by removing the margins. You can also use flexboxes with creative designs kind of like a corporate one. Also make sure it is mobile-optimised. Also include images called "img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg"

# Response:

# This prompt was rather specific and GPT-5 responded by making the webpage more light mode with blue tints to reflect the corporate-like request, as well as  added image placeholders and @media queries for mobile optimisation.

# Prompt 4:

# Make it so the site generates while you scroll down. Also make the info cards for the how it works part more flashing and striking, like they really deliver an impact and punch the user through the screen with the amazing specs. 

# Response:

# This prompt was one of the most creative ones, and GPT-5 responded by making the site generate while scrolling down and making the info cards on the specs have a blue outline for more pop and professionalism.

# Prompt 5: 

# Make the images cycle between img1.png and img2.png instead of having just img1.png

# Response:

# This prompt was simple but added a lot of customisation to the webpage. Instead of having just a static image, there is now a cycle between two images that show relevant contents to our site.
